# minifighter

A fun experiment in making a native GTK3 and Vala game for elementary OS. Styled with CSS.

## Building

1. Get elementary OS Loki.
2. Make sure you have `elementary-sdk` and `cmake-elementary` installed.
3. Inside the project, `mkdir build; cd build; cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ../`
